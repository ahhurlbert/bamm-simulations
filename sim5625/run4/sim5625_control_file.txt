#
#   BAMM control file for speciation-extinction analysis 
#
#   General Format: 
#       - Whitespace (tabs and spaces) is not important
#         and is stripped out when this file is parsed.
#       - Each parameter is specified as: par_name = par_value
#         where par_name is the name of the parameter
#         and par_value is the value you are assigning it.
#       - Parameter names must be spelled exactly.
#       - Comments start with # and go to the end of the line
#       - True/False parameters (e.g., runMCMC) are specified
#       - with "1" (True) or "0" (False).

# If TRUE will overwrite analysis result files (if present).

# NUMERICAL AND OTHER PARAMETERS

minCladeSizeForShift = 1
# Allows you to constrain location of possible rate-change events to occur
# only on branches with at least this many descendant tips. A value of 1
# allows shifts to occur on all branches. 

segLength = 0.02
# Controls the "grain" of the likelihood calculations. Approximates the 
# continuous-time change in diversification rates by breaking each branch into
# a constant-rate diversification segments, with each segment given a length
# determined by segLength
# segLength is in units of the root-to-tip distance of the tree. So, if the
# segLength parameter is 0.01, and the crown age of your tree is 50, the 
# "step size" of the constant rate approximation will be 0.5.
# If the value is greater than the branch length 
# (e.g., you have a branch of length < 0.5 in the preceding example)
# BAMM will not break the branch into segments but use the mean 
# rate across the entire branch. See Documentation for more information on this.
